🔍 What I Learned

This project helped me understand:
- How to structure code using **OOPs principles** (classes, objects, encapsulation)
- Working with **ArrayList**
- **Menu-driven programs** using Java's `Scanner`
- Project structuring and practice with Java methods and logic

> ❗ I followed a tutorial to build this project and am still learning how each part works. Sharing this as part of my learning journey and to track my growth in Core Java.
